                "Blog": "I am a passionate programmer making sure each program I make is easy to use and understand for the end user, I not only enjoy the problem-solving aspect of programming, but I also enjoy seeing people use the programs I make and have a meaningful impact on them. An example I can give is the game I am working on called Boomball Extreme where we went to Sheffield University for a showcase and seeing people coming back and playing our game was a rewarding experience. I also had a chance to help develop a mobile app called Smarter Thinking, in this internship, I developed the Front End and the Back End of the app, the database that was used was Firebase.During my undergraduate degree, I used JavaScript and React Native, during the summer I went to a Hackathon where my team created a website using React, the website was made with intentional bugs making it into a sort of game navigating through the site, trying to get to a certain page. In my internship with Smarter Thinking, I have been able to translate UI designs into functional front-end code. I have had experience using the Firebase database in my internship and I have also had experience using APIs such as Discord API where I managed to make a Discord bot playing blackjack and roulette with different users. I believe that with my knowledge of Firebase, I can transfer this AWS as well.The Smarter Thinking app was created to help people manage their emotions and I believe that I would be a good fit for this job since I have had experience working with that can help people with their mental health. I am confident that my skills, passion and dedication will also make me a great fit for this job. I am eager to contribute to your mission and grow with the company.Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you."
